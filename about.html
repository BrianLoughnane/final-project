	You've got an exciting project, amazing talent on your team, and infinite possibities to explore...you just need to find the <em>right person</em> to write the code.</aside>

	<p><strong>Hi, my name is Brian Loughnane and I am a full stack JavaScript Developer.</strong>  If you have a project that you find truly exciting, I want to be a part of it.  Sure I'm <em>slightly</em>  older than 25, but I'm as passionate, ambitious, and as hungry for an exciting project as anyone in the industry.</p>

	<p><strong>I recently completed a course in Front End Web Development with Thinkful.</strong>  Apart from that, I taught myself everything I know about coding.  I completed business school in 2009, receiving a degree in management.  I had been working in marketing for a tech company when I first started writing code.  I quickly realized <em>how much fun</em> coding is, as well as the boundless potential of what I could create, and I began rigorously studying computer programming languages, design principles, and UX concepts.</p>

	<blockquote><em>“Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program.”</em><br><span><em>-Linus Torvalds</em></span></blockquote>

	<p>That is why I'm so passionate about web development -- it's a world where anything is possible and <strong>the only limit is your imagination and sense of creativity.</strong>  It's incredibly rewarding to build something from scratch, and, it's just plain <em>fun</em>.</p>

	<blockquote><em>“Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.”</em><br><span><em>-Martin Fowler</em></span></blockquote>

	<p><strong>My experience is in leading teams.</strong>  I understand the dynamics that make successful teams, the structure of efficient communication, and how to learn from others.  The principles of effective communication are especially important when building computer programs in cooperation with a team.  I take pride in code that is clean, fast, and understandable.</p>
